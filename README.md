## Introduction

The Lockheed Martin CodeQuest Academy offers a series of programming challenges designed to enhance problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a personal collection of my solutions to these challenges, aiming to provide clear and efficient code implementations.

## Testing

Before submitting the solutions to [CodeQuestAcademy](https://lmcodequestacademy.com) they are tested using a [Test Script](test.py). This scirpt automatically runs the script and then checks the output against the expected output given by Lockheed Martin.
